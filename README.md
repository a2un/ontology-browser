# Ontology Browser

A "fork" of the ontology browser from the CO-ODE project
https://code.google.com/p/ontology-browser/

## Aims
* Make it easily buildable - maven
* Make it easily runnable - jetty (local) heroku (remote)
* Have it running again for demo purposes
* Make it more scalable - sort out stupid config problems
* Extract all rendering into views - jsp? or maybe just go full blown Spring MVC
* Tests!!

## Build

'''mvn clean package cargo:run'''
